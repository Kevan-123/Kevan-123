### ðŸ§  About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Kevan**, currently learning **Backend Web Development** at **ALX Africa**.  
I started with software engineering because I love **building systems that make life easier**.  
What truly inspires me is **solving problems** â€” not just coding, but creating solutions that scale and impact communities.

My ultimate goal is to work on **larger, collaborative projects** that challenge me and help me grow into a full-stack systems builder.
